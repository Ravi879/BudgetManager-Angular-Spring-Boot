### Why I have create this repository?

I was learning the spring boot and angular framework, and wanted to build something with what i have learnt. So i thought create a simple application which have the basic functionality like, login, registeration, session management and CRUD operation. I have create the spring boot application with spring security for securing REST API and consuming it from the angular application.


### Thanks

I'm always happy to hear your feedback!
Enjoy 🤘
